Instructions to run the project code, and obtain results required by the assignment.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The .zip file initially contains the following items:

1) 'floating_point.py' - python file:
  This contains the code developed needed to answer the first question from the assignment. The question is to write a short program to find the nearest representable real numbers higher and lower than a given floating point value. The file produces the results shown in the report. 

2) 'Lu_decomp.py' - python file:
	This contains the code developed needed to answer the second question from the assignment. The question is to write code to carry out LU decomposition of an arbitarty N x N matrix using Crouts algorithm. The file produces the results shown in the report. 

3) 'Interpolation.py' - python file:
	This contains the code developed needed to answer the third question from the assignment. The question is to write code to perform lagrange polynomial and cubic spline interpolation. The file produces the results shown in the report. 

4) 'Fourier.py' - python file:
	This contains the code developed needed to answer the fourth question from the assignment. The question is to write code to perform fourier transformaations on signals. The file produces the results shown in the report. 
  
5) 'ODE.py' - python file:
	This contains the code developed needed to answer the fifth question from the assignment. The question is to write code to perform foruth order Runge-Kutta method or fourth-order Adams-Bashforth method to solve Ordianry differenatial equations. #

6) 'Computational_Physics_report.pdf' - PDF file
   This contains the project report, highlighitng the research work.
